Welcome to "Guess the Code," an interactive web-based game that challenges your logical thinking and pattern recognition skills. This project combines the power of Node.js, Express.js, React, and Tailwind CSS to deliver a delightful gaming experience.

About the Game
"Guess the Code" is a modern take on the classic game "Mastermind." In this game, you'll take on the role of a codebreaker, trying to decipher a hidden code. The code consists of a sequence of numbers, and your task is to guess the correct sequence. With each guess, you'll receive feedback on the correctness of your choices. Can you crack the code in the fewest attempts?

Features
Sleek and Responsive UI: The frontend is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

Real-time Feedback: Experience real-time feedback on your guesses with dynamic color-coded indicators.

Scalable Backend: The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles API requests efficiently and securely.

User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and track their game statistics, including scores and the number of games played.

Leaderboard: Compete with other players and see where you stand on the global leaderboard.
